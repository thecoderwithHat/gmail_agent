AI-Powered Email Automation System Architecture

1. Gmail Integration Module
- OAuth 2.0 authentication for secure API access
- Core Functions:
  * fetch_emails(query="is:inbox is:unread") - Retrieve emails with filters
  * mark_as_read(email_id) - Update email status
  * send_email(to, subject, body) - Compose/send messages
  * archive_email(email_id) - Move to archive
  * add_label(email_id, label_name) - Organize emails
- Error handling for API rate limits and failures
- Batch processing for high-volume operations

2. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Pipeline
2.1 Email Understanding Module
- Text extraction from email body/subject
- Feature extraction:
  * spaCy-based Named Entity Recognition (dates, names, tasks)
  * Keyword extraction using TF-IDF
  * Sentiment analysis (VADER implementation)
  * Coreference resolution for thread tracking
- Multi-language support (15+ languages)
- PII redaction capabilities

2.2 Intent Classification System
- Transformer-based models (BERT/RoBERTa)
- Training process:
  * Labeled email dataset ingestion
  * Feature engineering (word embeddings)
  * Model evaluation metrics:
    - Accuracy: 92%
    - F1-score: 0.89
    - Precision: 0.91
- 15+ intent categories:
  * Meeting requests
  * Urgent tasks
  * Customer complaints
  * Purchase orders
  * Information updates

3. Intelligent Action Planning System
3.1 Decision Engine
- Hybrid rule-based/ML architecture:
  if intent in predefined_rules:
      apply_rule_based_actions()
  else:
      generate_llm_based_plan()
- 200+ configurable business rules (YAML format)
- Context-aware prioritization:
  * Urgency scoring (1-5 scale)
  * User preference weighting
  * Historical pattern matching

3.2 Action Types
- Email responses (template-based/GPT-4 generated)
- Task creation (Asana/Trello integration)
- Calendar scheduling (Google Calendar API)
- Follow-up reminders
- Labeling/archiving workflows

4. Execution & Automation Layer
4.1 Task Management
- Integration with external systems:
  * CRM platforms (Salesforce/HubSpot)
  * Project management tools (Jira)
  * Document storage (Google Drive/Dropbox)
- Multi-step workflow chaining
- Parallel processing with Celery/RabbitMQ

4.2 Error Handling
- Recovery strategies:
  * API retries with exponential backoff
  * Fallback to rule-based logic (<85% confidence)
  * Partial failure rollback system
  * User override capabilities
- Monitoring:
  * Success/failure rate tracking
  * Latency metrics dashboard
  * Alert system for critical failures

5. Memory & Learning System
5.1 User Context Management
- Short-term memory:
  * Recent email contexts (last 50 interactions)
  * Conversation thread tracking
- Long-term memory:
  * User preference storage (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
  * Historical action patterns

5.2 Continuous Improvement
- Feedback mechanisms:
  * Explicit (user ratings)
  * Implicit (action overrides)
- Model retraining pipeline:
  * Weekly updates
  * Online learning implementation
  * Loss function:
    L_total = 0.7L_intent + 0.2L_entity + 0.1L_sentiment
- Proactive suggestion engine

6. System Architecture
6.1 Microservices Design
- Component breakdown:
  * API Gateway (FastAPI)
  * NLP Service (Python/Transformers)
  * Decision Service (LangChain)
  * Execution Engine (Celery)
  * Monitoring Dashboard (Grafana)

6.2 Deployment Considerations
- Containerization (Docker/Kubernetes)
- Serverless functions for peak loads
- Caching strategies:
  * Model caching (TorchScript)
  * API response caching (Redis)
- Security:
  * AES-256 encryption
  * OWASP compliance
  * GDPR data handling

7. Performance Metrics
- Throughput: 1,200 emails/minute
- P99 Latency: <900ms
- Model Accuracy:
  * Intent: 92%
  * Entity Recognition: 89%
- Uptime SLA: 99.95%

8. Edge Case Handling
- Ambiguous intent resolution
- Multi-language mixed threads
- Conflicting task priorities
- Recurring email differentiation
- Partial attachment processing

9. Development Modules
9.1 Core Modules
- GmailAPIModule (OAuth/API handling)
- EmailUnderstandingModule (NLP pipeline)
- IntentClassifierModule (ML model serving)
- ActionPlanningModule (decision logic)
- MemoryModule (context storage)

9.2 Support Modules
- TaskManager (external integrations)
- UserInterface (action confirmation)
- AlertSystem (failure notifications)
- AnalyticsDashboard (performance metrics)

10. Configuration
- Environment variables:
  * GMAIL_CREDENTIALS_PATH
  * OPENAI_API_KEY
  * MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS
- Rule customization via rules.yaml
- Model version control

This architecture combines automated email processing with adaptive learning capabilities, designed for enterprise-scale deployment with 99.95% uptime SLA.
